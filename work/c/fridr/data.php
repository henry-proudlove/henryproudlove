'<p>Fridr was a startup service aiming to make people&rsquo;s daily online grind a little bit more beautiful by presenting its users with a curated stream of incredible content in the most unexpected of places. I was approached by its founders to give the brand and the service a visual direction.</p>
				
<p>The word Fridr comes from Old Norse and means something like a combination of beauty, peace and loveliness: thoroughly good stuff. Its descendants are alive and well in the Nordic languages and it should really should be written fri&eth;r, featuring the fantastic and, to my anglophone eyes, exotic &eth; character: the voiced dental fricative.</p>
		
<p>Early iterations of the logo featured this beauty but my clients were unsure about having a logo that few people would know how to&#8230; you know&#8230; read. They were right on one level I suppose, but wrong on so many others.</p>

<p>Typographic wrangling aside, I feel like the final version still bears the marks of its Scandinavian heritage. Given that the brand would have to sit alongside a great variety of different content, I wanted to give it an unassuming and open feel, as sleek and Swedish as a sauna.</p>'
