'<p>Roots &amp; Shoots, part of the Jane Goodall institute, is an international hands-on environmental and humanitarian education program. They help people to take practical steps towards improving the world around them.</p>
<p>They have, for instance, planted over a million trees in Inner Mongolia, China, with the help of nearly 1000 volunteers. Reversing the effects of desertification and sinking tonnes of CO2 back into the ground.</p>

<p>This film, a rare chance for me to direct a live action piece, tells the story of Jeff: a man so overwhelmed by the world\'s environmental problems that he is literally paralysed; a rabbit in the ecological headlights. We follow Jeff around his world, filled with people like him, bamboozled by the enormity of modern China&rsquo;s environmental problems, until he encounters Roots &amp; Shoot </p>

<p>Working with the fantastic production team at Studio Output, Beijing and a really creative and open client made this a really great project to work on. I relished the opportunity to work on every aspect of the piece from the concept, writing and storyboarding the right through to the final edit, grade and sound design.</p>'
