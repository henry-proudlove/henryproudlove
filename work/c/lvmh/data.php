'<p>LVMH is short for luxury. The group&rsquo;s portfolio includes iconic fashion houses like C&eacute;line, Dior, Marc Jacobs and more, plus world famous names in wines and spirits, jewellery, watches and retail.</p>

<p>It was great to be part of the pitch team FCB put together to create a site for LVMH that aims to give a coherent voice to a company that is always going to be a patchwork of strong and identifiable brands, but should be a exquisitely put together patchwork.</p>

<p>We devised a solution to serve a wide variety of different use cases from investors to fashion fans, aiming to take each user on a journey through the world of LVMH that feels bespoke, unique to their interests and aims.</p>

<p>We wanted to showcase the amazing work being done by individual houses and to tell a story about the group&rsquo;s uniting principles of craft, excellence and luxury.</p>'
