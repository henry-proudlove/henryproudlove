'<p>I&rsquo;ve been living and working in China since January 2014. Moving to such a wildly different culture has been mind-bending. I have had a lot of the assumptions about I held about China before coming here overturned and overturned again.</p>

<p>A particularly valuable aspect of this experience has been the opportunity to work with and mentor numerous fantastic, young, Chinese creatives and designers. This project is testament to that. </p>

<p>Designed by Dawn Cai during her internship at Studio Output&rsquo;s Beijing office in the summer of 2014 this book explores China&rsquo;s nascent creative industries.</p>

<p>Asking people to complete the phrase &ldquo;Design in China is like&#8230;&rdquo; garnered a wide variety of responses. From the hopeful &ldquo;Design in China is like a child learning to grow up&rdquo; to the poetic: &ldquo;Design is China is like a barefoot doctor&rdquo; right through to the downright brutal &ldquo;Design in China is like punching yourself in the face&rdquo;.</p>

<p>This phrase serves as a vehicle for people to express their ambitions and frustrations about working in the creative.</p>'
