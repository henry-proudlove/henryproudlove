							I am an ambitious, creative professional, excited by great ideas and by bringing them to life. During nearly a decade in the design 						and advertising industry, I’ve worked in digital, print, film and experiential media for some of the world’s best brands, at some of 						the world’s leading agencies.
						</p>
						<span>
							<p>
							I have lead teams working on projects everything ranging from websites to TV commercials. I’m hands-on, highly skilled and motivated to 						produce the very best work; I want to inspire these qualities in others.
							</p>
							<p>
							I began my career as a graphic designer obsessed with typography and the possibilities of print, before moving into digital design 						and animation. Recently, I have been working in live action concepting and art direction. 
							</p>
							<p>
							What excites me most is finding new and creative ways to integrate all the facets of my experience, producing work that is innovative, 						playful and beautiful.
